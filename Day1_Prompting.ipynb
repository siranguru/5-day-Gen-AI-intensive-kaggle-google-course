You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Bartholomew, seized by a sudden urge, leaped from the windowsill, landing on the garden below. He knew this was his chance.\n\nHe padded through the garden, past the familiar rose bushes and the sun-drenched tomatoes. His nose led him on a winding path, past the neighbor's fence, and into the wilderness beyond. The world was a kaleidoscope of smells – damp earth, pine needles, and the faint musk of something wild. \n\nBartholomew, emboldened by his newfound freedom, climbed a towering oak tree. From his vantage point, he surveyed the world. There were houses, some bigger than his own, with strange, colorful objects moving about. A dog, much bigger than any he'd seen, barked at him from below. Bartholomew hissed and puffed up his fur, a warning that was easily ignored.\n\nHe spent the day exploring, his senses tingling with new experiences. He chased butterflies, stalked squirrels, and even had a face-off with a grumpy badger. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, Bartholomew found himself at the edge of a field. He watched in awe as fireflies lit up the night, a magical sight he'd never seen before.\n\nThe air grew cold and Bartholomew, his stomach grumbling with hunger, realized it was time to return. He retraced his steps, guided by the familiar scent of his home. As he walked, he felt a sense of accomplishment, a thrill that only a true adventurer could understand. \n\nHe slipped through the open window, back into the safety of his own home. His owner, a kindly old woman, greeted him with a loving pat and a bowl of fresh milk. Bartholomew purred, a deep rumble in his chest, as he settled down for the night.

Bartholomew, with the agility of a seasoned acrobat, slipped inside. The truck rumbled to life, and Bartholomew found himself on a journey unlike any he'd ever known.\n\nThe world outside his usual window was a kaleidoscope of sights and smells. He saw towering buildings that scraped the sky, bustling markets overflowing with exotic fruits, and a vast, shimmering ocean. He sniffed the scent of fresh bread, salty air, and the sweet perfume of blooming flowers.\n\nHis adventure took him to a bustling city park, where he encountered a group of pigeons. They were wary at first, but Bartholomew, with his charm and a few well-placed purrs, convinced them to share their crumbs. He even learned a few pigeon-speak phrases, which he found surprisingly useful.\n\nNext, he found himself in a cozy bookstore, where he spent hours curled up on a stack of dusty tomes, dreaming of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. He even managed to snag a juicy mouse from the owner's lunch, a feat that earned him a scolding but also a grudging respect.\n\nFinally, after a day of thrilling escapades, Bartholomew found himself back in his familiar neighborhood. He slipped out of the truck, a little weary but infinitely richer in experience. He had seen the world, tasted its flavors, and learned its secrets.\n\nBack home, he curled up on his rug, the sunbeams now warm and inviting. He was no longer bored.
